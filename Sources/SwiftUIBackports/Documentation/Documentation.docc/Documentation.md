# ``SwiftUIBackports``

Introducing a collection of SwiftUI backports to make your iOS development easier.

## Overview

Many backports support iOS 13+ but where UIKIt features were introduced in later versions, the same will be applicable to these backports, to keep parity with UIKit.

In some cases, I've also included additional APIs that bring more features to your SwiftUI development.

All backports are fully documented, in most cases using Apple's own documentation for consistency. Please refer to the header docs or Apple's original documentation for more details.

There is also a [Demo](http://github.com/shaps80/SwiftUIBackportsDemo) project available where you can see full demonstrations of all backports and additional features, including reference code to help you get started.

Lastly, I hope this repo also serves as a great resource for how you can backport effectively with minimal hacks üëç
